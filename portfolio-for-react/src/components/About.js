      <p>
        Welcome to my digital portfolio, my name is Hanna Ferris. I graduated
        from the University of Dubuque with a Bachelor of Business
        Administration in Marketing and Communication Minor. I am currently
        working to get a Web Development Certificate by taking on a full-stack
        coding program, through Trilogy at the University of Arizona with an
        expected graduation date of May 10, 2021. Upon graduation, I want to be
        able to incorporate my marketing degree with the certificate to land a
        career in the IT industry. My goal is to become a Business Analyst or
        Quality Assurance Specialist in a company, where Iâ€™ll be able to utilize
        my background in marketing and my talents in Web Development to
        strengthen business requirements within IT.
